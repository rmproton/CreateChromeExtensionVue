  ## Folder Structure and Architecture

  The generated folder is structured to maintain a clear separation of concerns and facilitate easy navigation and maintenance of the project. Here's an overview of the folder structure and its components:

    - **/public**: This folder contains the publicly accessible files of the extension, including the manifest file, popup HTML, and any other assets that need to be exposed to the user.
      - **manifest.json**: The manifest file defines the extension's metadata, permissions, and functionality.
      - **popup.html**: The HTML file for the popup that appears when the user clicks the extension's icon.
      - **options.html**: The HTML file for the options page that allows users to customize the extension's settings.
    - **/src**: This folder contains the source code for the extension, including the popup's JavaScript and any other scripts required for the extension's functionality.
      - **/popup**: This folder contains the JavaScript files for the popup, including the main entry point and any other scripts required for the popup's functionality.
        - **main.ts**: The main entry point for the popup's JavaScript.
        - **popup.vue**: The Vue component for the popup, defining its structure and behavior.
      - **/options**: This folder contains the JavaScript files for the options page, which allows users to customize the extension's settings.
        - **main.ts**: The main entry point for the options page's JavaScript.
        - **options.vue**: The Vue component for the options page, defining its structure and behavior.
      - **/background**: This folder contains the JavaScript files for the background script, which runs in the background and can interact with web pages.
        - **background.ts**: The main entry point for the background script.
      - **/assets**: This folder contains static assets such as images, icons, and other media.
    - **/dist**: Created on `npm run build`. This folder contains the distribution-ready files generated by the build process. It includes the compiled JavaScript files and any other assets required for the extension to function.
    - **/node_modules**: Created on `npm install`. This folder contains the project's dependencies installed using npm or yarn.
  - **readme.md**: This file provides an overview of the project, including its structure, architecture, and development commands.
  - **package.json**: This file contains project metadata, dependencies, and scripts for managing the project.
  - **tsconfig.json**: This file configures the TypeScript compiler for the project.
  - **vite.config.ts**: This file configures the Vite build process for the project.

  This structure allows for a clear separation of concerns between the public-facing assets, the source code, and the distribution-ready files. It also makes it easy to manage and maintain the project's dependencies.
